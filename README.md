# Advent_of_Code2020
Advent of Code is a coding competition which takes place every December. 

Each problem has two parts as well as an individual input different for each user. Some problems contain classes or functions.

The main code of a problem is written in a jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) while any classes and functions are python files (.py), and the input is a text file (.txt)
